# Changelog

All notable changes to Agnes AI Data Analyst.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), pre-1.0 — public surface (CLI flags, REST endpoints, `instance.yaml` schema, `extract.duckdb` contract) may shift between minor versions; breaking changes called out under **Changed** or **Removed** with the **BREAKING** marker.

CalVer image tags (`stable-YYYY.MM.N`, `dev-YYYY.MM.N`) are produced for every CI build; semver tags (`v0.X.Y`) are cut at release boundaries and reference the same commit as a `stable-*` tag from the same day.

## [Unreleased]

<!-- Add bullets here. Group: Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed / Internal.
     Mark breaking changes with **BREAKING** at the start of the bullet. -->

### Fixed

- `docker-compose.yml` caddy service now passes `CADDY_TLS` through to the container (`- CADDY_TLS` bare-form passthrough). Without it the `Caddyfile` `{$CADDY_TLS:default}` substitution always falls back to cert-file mode regardless of what the operator wrote into `.env`, and Caddy crash-loops on Let's Encrypt / internal-CA deployments. Should have shipped with #52; first attempt was #55, accidentally closed before merging.

### Internal

- `CLAUDE.md` — non-negotiable changelog discipline: every PR touching user-visible behavior must update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]` in the same PR.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-04-26

First tagged semver release. The `version = "2.x"` strings that appeared in earlier `pyproject.toml` snapshots were arbitrary placeholders from the initial scaffold and never reflected actual API maturity — resetting to pre-1.0 to signal that things may still shift.

### Added — Auth

- **Google Workspace groups on `/profile`.** OAuth callback fetches the signed-in user's group memberships via Cloud Identity (`searchTransitiveGroups` with the `security` label — see `docs/auth-groups.md` for the GCP setup checklist and the `security`-vs-`discussion_forum` gotcha). Profile link added to the user dropdown.
- **Password reset + invite flows** for web and admin (`/auth/password/reset`, `/admin/users/invite`).
- **Personal access tokens (PAT)** with separate `:typ=pat` JWT claim, per-token revoke, last-used IP tracking, "My tokens" + admin "All tokens" UI.
- **Email magic-link provider** (itsdangerous-signed token).
- **Optional `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`** to pre-hash the seed admin (dev convenience).

### Added — Deploy

- **`keboola-deploy.yml` workflow.** Tag-triggered alternative to `release.yml` for shared dev VMs that want explicit "deploy when I tag" semantics. Publishes immutable `:keboola-deploy-<tag>` + floating `:keboola-deploy-latest` alias.
- **Caddy + Let's Encrypt + corporate-CA TLS.** `Caddyfile` parametrized via `$CADDY_TLS` env var so a single file serves three regimes: cert-file (corp PKI), Let's Encrypt auto-issue, Caddy-internal-CA. URL-driven cert rotation with self-signed fallback (`scripts/grpn/agnes-tls-rotate.sh`). `docker-compose.tls.yml` overlay closes host `:8000` when Caddy fronts.
- **`dev_instances` schema in `customer-instance` Terraform module** gains optional `tls_mode` + `domain` (mirrors `prod_instance`). `infra-v1.6.0` tag.
- **Optional Google OAuth credentials from Secret Manager.** Module reads `google-oauth-client-{id,secret}` at boot if present; graceful fallback so non-Google deployments aren't affected.
- **`LOCAL_DEV_MODE` + `make local-dev-up` / `local-dev-down`** for one-keystroke local stack with magic-link auth pre-wired.
- **Per-developer `dev-<prefix>-latest` GHCR alias** for branches matching `<prefix>/<branch>` — push-to-deploy on personal dev VMs.
- **`/setup` web wizard** for first-time instance setup, plus headless `POST /api/admin/configure` and `POST /api/admin/discover-and-register`.
- **Smoke-test job in CI** (Docker-in-CI after every release) + `scripts/smoke-test.sh` for post-deploy verification.

### Added — CLI

- **Wheel distribution** + auto-update check on startup.
- `--version` flag, `--dry-run` + `X/N` progress on `da sync`, durable sync (atomic writes + manifest hash + retry on transient errors).
- gzip on JSON/HTML responses (server-side).

### Added — Data

- **Remote query engine.** Two-phase BigQuery + DuckDB engine for tables too large to sync locally (`--register-bq` flag).
- **Business metrics.** Standardized `metric_definitions` table in DuckDB with starter pack importer (`da metrics import`).
- **`/api/health`** returns `version`, `channel`, `commit_sha`, `image_tag`, `schema_version`.
- **Custom connector mount support** (`connectors/custom/`).
- **OpenAPI snapshot test** for breaking-change detection.

### Added — Docs / tooling

- `docs/auth-groups.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/HACKATHON.md`, `docs/ONBOARDING.md` runbooks.
- `scripts/debug/probe_google_groups.py` — stdlib-only probe for diagnosing Cloud Identity API issues without a deploy cycle.
- Schema migration safety tests (idempotency, data preservation, snapshot).
- Pre-migration snapshot of `system.duckdb` before schema upgrades.
- Auto-generated JWT and session secrets with file persistence (`/data/state/.jwt_secret`).
- Startup banner logging version, channel, and schema version.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (deployment)** — Caddy compose profile renamed `production` → `tls`. Existing `docker compose --profile production up -d` invocations need to switch.
- **BREAKING (deployment)** — Default `Caddyfile` mode is now cert-file (`tls /certs/fullchain.pem /certs/privkey.pem`); for the previous Let's Encrypt auto-issue behaviour set `CADDY_TLS=tls <ops-email>` in `.env`. See `docs/auth-groups.md` and `Caddyfile` inline docs.
- Schema migration v5→v6→v7: adds `users.active`, `personal_access_tokens` table, `personal_access_tokens.last_used_ip`. Auto-applied at boot.
- Image-level `AGNES_VERSION` now sourced from `pyproject.toml` at build time (no more drift between `da --version` and the package metadata).
- **Vendor-agnostic OSS rule** codified in `CLAUDE.md` — customer-specific names, hostnames, project IDs belong in consumer infra repos, not in this OSS distribution.

### Fixed — Security

- Open-redirect guard for backslash in `safe_next_path`.
- `SessionMiddleware max_age=3600 + https_only` (was browser-session forever, plain-HTTP-OK).
- Timezone-aware datetimes in Keboola metadata cache.
- Atomic magic-link token consumption (closes double-use race under concurrent clicks).
- Bootstrap backdoor closed when passwordless seed admin exists.
- urllib3 1.26→2.6.3 (resolves 4 Dependabot security alerts).
- argon2-cffi adopted for password hashing.
- See [docs/padak-security.md](docs/padak-security.md) for the full audit.

### Fixed — Other

- `uvicorn --proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips='*'` so OAuth callbacks resolve to https when behind a TLS terminator.
- `scripts/grpn/agnes-tls-rotate.sh` hardened: `--max-redirs 0` + `--proto '=https'` on cert fetch, post-fetch PEM validation (rejects HTML error pages from corp portals), `ulimit -c 0` to suppress coredumps that could leak the unencrypted privkey, POSIX-safe `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` array expansion.
- `scripts/tls-fetch.sh` — generic URL fetcher (`sm://`, `gs://`, `https://`, `file://`) with redirect refusal + PEM validation.
- `kbcstorage` moved to optional dep — unblocks urllib3 security updates; primary Keboola path now uses the DuckDB Keboola extension.
- Dependencies consolidated into `pyproject.toml` (no more `requirements.txt`).

### Internal

- Test suite expanded to 1357+ tests (4 layers — unit, integration, web smoke, journey).
