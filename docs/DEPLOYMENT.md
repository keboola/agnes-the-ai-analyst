# Deployment Guide

Agnes supports two deployment paths. Pick the one that matches your use case.

## 1. Terraform — managed, multi-customer (recommended)

For Keboola-operated deployments and anyone running Agnes for multiple customers on GCP.

**Follow:** [`ONBOARDING.md`](ONBOARDING.md)

Highlights:
- Per-customer GCP project + private infra repo cloned from [`keboola/agnes-infra-template`](https://github.com/keboola/agnes-infra-template)
- Reusable Terraform module `infra/modules/customer-instance` (versioned — `infra-vX.Y.Z` tags)
- Prod + optional branch-aware dev VMs
- Persistent SSD data disk with daily snapshots
- Secret Manager for tokens (no plaintext in VM metadata)
- OS Login for SSH, dedicated VM service account with scoped `secretAccessor`
- Cron-based auto-upgrade (pulls `:stable` image digest every 5 min)
- Caddy TLS with corporate-CA or self-managed certs mounted from `/data/state/certs`; daily auto-rotation from a URL (`TLS_FULLCHAIN_URL`) with zero-downtime `SIGUSR1` reload
- Uptime check + alert policy per VM (wire a notification channel to be paged)
- CI/CD in the private repo: PR → `terraform plan`, merge to main → `apply-dev` auto, `apply-prod` gated by reviewer
- First-boot bootstrap via `POST /auth/bootstrap`

Target onboarding time: **< 1 hour** per customer.

## 2. Docker Compose — OSS self-host

For running Agnes on your own VM / bare metal without Terraform. You're responsible for provisioning and maintenance.

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 24.04 (or any Linux with Docker)
- 2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, 30 GB SSD minimum
- Docker Engine + Compose plugin
- Public IP with ports 80/443 (if using Caddy TLS) or 8000 (plain HTTP) open
- Data-source credentials (e.g., Keboola Storage token)

### Steps

1. Clone the Agnes repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keboola/agnes-the-ai-analyst.git /opt/agnes
   cd /opt/agnes
   ```

2. Create `.env`:

   ```bash
   cat > .env <<'EOF'
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
   DATA_DIR=/data
   DATA_SOURCE=keboola
   KEBOOLA_STORAGE_TOKEN=<your-token>
   KEBOOLA_STACK_URL=<your-stack-url>
   SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL=<your-email>
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   AGNES_TAG=stable
   EOF
   chmod 600 .env
   ```

3. Mount a persistent disk at `/data` (optional but recommended — survives host rebuild). If you do, use the overlay:

   ```bash
   docker compose \
       -f docker-compose.yml \
       -f docker-compose.prod.yml \
       -f docker-compose.host-mount.yml \
       up -d
   ```

   Without a persistent disk (data on Docker named volume, tied to boot disk):

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

4. Bootstrap your admin password via `POST /auth/bootstrap`:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://<host>:8000/auth/bootstrap \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"email":"<your-email>","password":"<strong-password>"}'
   ```

5. Open `http://<host>:8000/login` and sign in.

### TLS (optional)

Caddy runs as the TLS terminator. It reads certs from `/data/state/certs/{fullchain,privkey}.pem` bind-mounted into the container. Two provisioning modes:

**A. Public internet (Let's Encrypt)** — for this path, override the `Caddyfile` to drop the `tls` directive (so Caddy auto-issues) and skip steps below. Not covered here anymore; see git history prior to the `feat(tls)` change if you need the ACME flow.

**B. Corporate CA / self-managed certs** (recommended, and what the infra repo ships):

1. Generate a CSR + private key, submit CSR to your corporate PKI, receive a signed cert chain.
2. Drop the files on the host:
   ```
   /data/state/certs/fullchain.pem   (0644, chain = leaf + intermediates)
   /data/state/certs/privkey.pem     (0600)
   ```
3. Set `DOMAIN` in `.env`, then start with the `tls` profile + overlay:
   ```bash
   DOMAIN=agnes.example.com \
       docker compose \
           -f docker-compose.yml \
           -f docker-compose.prod.yml \
           -f docker-compose.tls.yml \
           --profile tls up -d
   ```
   The `docker-compose.tls.yml` overlay closes direct `:8000` on the host; all traffic enters via `:443`.

#### Automatic rotation

`scripts/grpn/agnes-tls-rotate.sh` refetches the cert daily from a stable URL and reloads Caddy via `SIGUSR1` only when the bytes changed — no downtime, no reload when the URL content hasn't moved. Invoke with these env vars in `.env`:

| Var | Required | Schemes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TLS_FULLCHAIN_URL` | yes | `https://`, `sm://<secret>`, `gs://<obj>`, `file://` | URL corp security team refreshes in place |
| `TLS_PRIVKEY_URL` | optional | same | Leave empty to reuse the on-disk key across cert rotations |

The rotate script expects `scripts/tls-fetch.sh` at `/usr/local/bin/tls-fetch.sh` (a generic URL fetcher). On the infra repo's Terraform-managed VMs, both scripts are installed automatically by `startup.sh` and run via a daily systemd timer; for manual compose deployments, copy them under `/usr/local/bin/` and wire the timer yourself.

### Upgrades (manual)

```bash
cd /opt/agnes
git pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Or set up a cron job — see `infra/modules/customer-instance/startup-script.sh.tpl` for the reference implementation.

## Which path should I pick?

| | Terraform | Docker Compose |
|---|---|---|
| Setup time | ~45 min first customer, ~15 min each subsequent | ~30 min |
| Infra-as-Code | Full (all resources in git) | Partial (compose.yml only) |
| Secret storage | GCP Secret Manager | `.env` file on host |
| Upgrades | Auto via cron, gated prod apply | Manual `docker compose pull` |
| Backups | Daily GCP snapshots, 30-day retention | You set up yourself |
| Monitoring / alerts | GCP Uptime Checks + alert policy | You set up yourself |
| TLS | Caddy + corp cert, auto-rotated from URL | Caddy + corp cert, manual or user-scripted rotation |
| Best for | Multi-tenant SaaS, production | Single-instance self-host, learning |
