"""Monotonic per-session frame sequence numbers (wave-2F task 2).

Every outbound chat frame gains ``seq`` (int, monotonic per ``chat_id``) and
``id`` (``f"{chat_id}:{seq}"``). Stamping happens at the frame-emission
choke points:

- ``app.chat.manager.ChatManager._broadcast`` — the single seam ALL runner
  frames (token/tool_call/tool_result/assistant_message/done/...) and every
  manager-originated broadcast (ready/error/cancelled/session_renamed) pass
  through, fanning out to every sink (web WS, ``SlackSinkBridge``, co-drive
  joiners) alike.
- ``ChatManager._seat_sink`` / ``ChatManager.add_sink`` — the per-connection
  ``{"type": "ready"}`` frame sent to exactly the newly-seated sink (not
  broadcast, so it falls outside ``_broadcast``).
- ``app.api.chat`` — the two ``runner_not_ready`` error frames sent directly
  on the WS by the route handler before a ``LiveSession`` even exists.

Frames replayed verbatim from ``LiveSession.turn_buffer`` (mid-turn
reconnect/join) are NOT re-stamped — they already carry the ``seq``/``id``
assigned when they were first broadcast, and re-stamping would both waste a
sequence number and change the id of a frame the client may have already
seen. Historical messages reconstructed from ``chat_messages`` in
``add_sink`` are also left unstamped: they predate this mechanism entirely
(no persisted seq column) and the additive/back-compat contract is that a
client tolerates frames without ``seq``/``id`` — see ``docs`` note on the
web client side (``app/web/static/js/chat.js``).

This task (wave-2F task 2) was envelope-only: it did not build a replay
stream. Wave-2F task 3 (``app.chat.replay``) builds on it — every stamped
frame is also appended to a bounded coordination-backend stream
(``chat-out:{chat_id}``), and ``peek_seq`` (below) plus that stream answer
"replay everything after seq N" on WS reconnect.

#: Coordination-backend TTL for the per-session seq counter.
#:
#: ``coordination().incr`` only applies ``ttl_s`` the first time a key is
#: created (see ``CoordinationBackend.incr``), so this must comfortably
#: outlive the ENTIRE wall-clock lifetime of a session, not just one ACTIVE
#: stretch — a session can go PAUSED for up to ``ChatConfig.paused_ttl_seconds``
#: (default 7 days = 604800s) and then resume for up to another
#: ``ChatConfig.max_session_seconds`` (default 4h) before its next frame. The
#: previous value (6h) was sized only for the ACTIVE half of that story: any
#: session paused past 6h — well within the 7-day paused_ttl default, let
#: alone an operator raising it further — would see the counter expire and
#: restart at seq=1, producing a duplicate seq/id and breaking the replay/
#: dedup contract the future replay mechanism (wave-2F task 3) depends on.
#:
#: Hardened to a fixed value safely past ``paused_ttl_seconds +
#: max_session_seconds`` under default config (604800 + 14400 = 619200s),
#: with margin: 9 days. Not wired to a live ``ChatConfig`` instance — the
#: seq counter is a tiny, cheap coordination-backend key, so a large fixed
#: TTL on it costs nothing, and doing so avoids threading a config object
#: through every ``stamp_frame``/``FrameSequencer`` call site (``_broadcast``,
#: ``_seat_sink``, ``add_sink``, and the two direct-WS ``runner_not_ready``
#: stamps in ``app.api.chat``) for a bound that's already generous relative
#: to the defaults. An operator who raises ``paused_ttl_seconds`` or
#: ``max_session_seconds`` past this margin should bump this constant too.
