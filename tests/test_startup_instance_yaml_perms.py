"""Contract: the module's startup script leaves instance.yaml owner-only.

`/data/state/instance.yaml` holds the Postgres URL with its password inline,
plus whatever credentials an operator put in a connector overlay, and it sits
on the data volume that several non-root containers mount. Created by root
under the default umask it lands world-readable (0644), while the equivalent
`/opt/agnes/.env` is 0600 — the asymmetry this guard exists to prevent.

The chmod must sit OUTSIDE the `if [ ! -f "$INSTANCE_YAML" ]` create branch:
an existing file is exactly the case that needs repairing, since deployments
provisioned before this line — or written by an app-side surface that predates
its own chmod — already carry the loose mode.
